# Handling Hasura Actions in Azure functions

## Dev Env
### Create the Azure function
```
func new --template "Http Trigger" --name getGreetings
```

### Create Hasura Action
In Hasura console create a new Action

For local development the host should be 172.17.0.1 - this refers to the host on which docker is running   
```
http://172.17.0.1:7071/api/getGreetings
```

## Extract the base url into env file
Add a **ACTION_BASE_URL** to the env file and set the base url there http://172.17.0.1:7071  
Then edit [actions.yaml](../hasura-metadata/metadata/actions.yaml) and modify the urls as **'{{ACTION_BASE_URL}}/api/getGreetings'** <<- Note the quotes

> [!NOTE]  
> The env variable ACTION_BASE_URL must be set in the environment running the Hasura server. In our case it will work since the same env file is used by docker env also
