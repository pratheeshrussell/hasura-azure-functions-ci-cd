# Push to Hasura Cloud from Github Actions

## Create Secret
In your github repo, go to settings and create a secret. I have named it **HASURA_CLOUD_ENV** if you use a different name modify the workflow file as well. Add the content for the .env file that would be used in production (or other environment).

> [!NOTE]  
> The Secret should be added under **Secrets and variables -> Actions -> Repository Secrets**

## Check the work flow file
check the file *.github/workflows/hasura-deploy.yml* and make any changes if needed (like secret name)

## Connect to DB in Cloud
Add connection to the DB in the remote Hasura instance. The tables and metadata can be pushed but connection can't be created from workflow.
