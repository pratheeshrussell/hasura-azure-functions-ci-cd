## Getting a template reference
> [!WARNING]  
> This may not run as it is, if so use this template only as a reference to create your own
  
* Goto Azure portal and create a new function app   
* Get to the last step ie., Review + Create   
* at the bottom "Download a template for automation"   
* you will need the template as well as the parameters file
