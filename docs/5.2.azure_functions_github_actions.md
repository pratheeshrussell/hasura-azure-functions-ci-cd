# Push to Azure functions from Github Actions

## Github secrets
We will reuse the credential
* AZURE_CREDENTIALS   
Other than that we need the **AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_NAME** this has been set in previous step in parameter json. Not sure how that can be extracted. For now I have set it as a env variable in the yml file itself
