# Migration

## Develop
If you started the console with `hasura console --console-port 9500` command. Changes will be tracked and migration files will be created automatically.   

> [!TIP]
> If you make multiple changes relevant for the same feature. Multiple migration files maybe created. You can squash them into a single set by using the **migrate squash** command

## Production
To apply a migration run 
```
hasura migrate apply --database-name "Test DB"
hasura metadata apply
```
